    <h2>How to Make a Crab Salad</h2>

    Here’s a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make this homemade crab salad recipe: 

    <ol>
      <li>Mix the ingredients until combined.</li>
      <li>Chill overnight. </li>
      <li>Stir before serving. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Can You Make Crab Salad Ahead of Time? </h2>

    Yes! In fact, since the crab salad will need to chill overnight, it’s best to make it a day or two in advance. You can store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. 

    <h2>Can You Freeze Crab Salad? </h2>

    We don’t recommend freezing crab salad. Mayonnaise doesn’t freeze well, as it tends to separate during the thawing process. Fortunately, this recipe is so delicious there likely won’t be any leftovers!
